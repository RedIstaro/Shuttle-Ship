# Shuttle-Ship
Map for Get-Togethers, Four Players. Planned for a Stronghold kind of mapset, really.
This first map is to contain from bow to stern, the Flight Deck, Cabin and Galley, Bathroom (funny room), the cargo hold, and the exit ramp. 
Planned features are four to six maps, labelled DEFC 01-06.

For those part of the projects (and outside), the ship is to be worked on. Don't steal OP's fire!
